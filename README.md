# Amazon-Vine-Challenge
Module 16
Deliverable 3

Amazon's shoppers depend on product reviews online to make their purchase decisions and make their vine review datasets available publicly. 
Since Vine reviews are large and can exceed the capacity of local machines, we are using Spark and AWS.

There were 94 Vine Reviews and 40,471 non vine reviews.

48 Vine reviews were 5 star, whereas 15663 non vine were 5 star.

51% of vine review were 5 star and 39% of non vine reviews were 5 star.
